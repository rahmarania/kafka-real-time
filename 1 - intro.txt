How to analyze fast moving, variety, and huge volume of data real time?

- batch processing is impossible for some cases due to fast decision making. 
- we need real time data processing to produce decisions in seconds.
- another reason why using real time
1. fast decision
2. anomaly detection for security
3. optimisation efficiency
4. competitive, business can see market trend fast

example of real time data processing
1. self-driving car
2. stock market
3. e-commerce
4. API for weather detection, pricing in online driver

real-time process
Data Ingestion (from API, log, or other sources) > stream processing [kafka](as bridge to process what method our data should done, prediction, update data, show notification, etc) > output and action

WHY KAFKA?
Kafka is one of the Distributed Event Streaming Platform that helps to handle large data streams in real-time.
how is it works?
1. Producer (produce data)
2. kafka will flow the data into each process as their need (topic)
3. broker (store data and manage distribution)
4. consumer (receive data from kafka and process it)
